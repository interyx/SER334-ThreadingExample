This repository holds two basic examples of threading.  One is written in C, the other in Java, but they basically do the same thing: print out numbers from 0-19 using multiple threads of execution.  They contain plenty of documentation about what's going on and why and hopefully should be illuminating for anyone struggling with threading, syntax, and the different ways threads can be created or data passed into them.
